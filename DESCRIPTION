Description: Color maps designed to improve graph readability for readers with 
    common forms of color blindness and/or color vision deficiency. The color 
    maps are also perceptually-uniform, both in regular form and also when 
    converted to black-and-white for printing. This package also contains 
    'ggplot2' bindings for discrete and continuous color and fill scales. A lean
    version of the package called 'viridisLite' that does not include the 
    'ggplot2' bindings can be found at 
    <https://cran.r-project.org/package=viridisLite>.
