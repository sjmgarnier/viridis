Description: Implementation of the 'viridis' - the default -, 'magma', 'plasma', 
    'inferno', and 'cividis' color maps for 'R'. 'viridis', 'magma', 'plasma', 
    and 'inferno' are ported from 'matplotlib' <http://matplotlib.org/>, a 
    popular plotting library for 'python'. 'cividis', was developed by Jamie R. 
    Nuñez and Sean M. Colby. These color maps are designed in such a way that 
    they will analytically be perfectly perceptually-uniform, both in regular 
    form and also when converted to black-and-white. They are also designed to 
    be perceived by readers with the most common form of color blindness (all 
    color maps in this package) and color vision deficiency ('cividis' only).
