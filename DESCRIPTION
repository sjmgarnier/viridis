Title: Matplotlib Default Color Map
Version: 0.1
Date: 2015-07-16
Author: Simon Garnier <garnier@njit.edu>
Maintainer: Simon Garnier <garnier@njit.edu>
Description: Port of the new Matplotlib default color map ('viridis') to R. This color map is designed in such a way that it will analytically be perfectly perceptually-uniform, both in regular form and also when converted to black-and-white. It is also designed to be perceived by readers with the most common form of color blindness.
